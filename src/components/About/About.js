                    <i>A brief and relaxed resume.</i>
//                     <br/>I've been working on Telefonica (Telecommunications) and Michelin (Tyres).
//                     <br/>They are big co's not fully technological. Anyways I've been always focused on the startup world.
                    <br/>My areas of delight can be almost anything related to technology.
                    <br/>Data engineering? Of course I like.
                    <br/>Product experience? Let's dig it.
                    <br/>Full stack? Count on me.
                    <br/>Need to write an article? I will try my best.
//                     <br/>Let's run a company? Let's do it.
                    <br/>As you can notice, my experience is broad and not focused on a simple topic in depth.
                    <br/>Anyways in data engineering I stand out a little more.
