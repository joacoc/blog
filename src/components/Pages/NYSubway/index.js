                I would love to remember from which book I read the next statement: <br/>
                There was a time (near 1980) where New York was having struggle to maintain their subway trains clean and good looking.<br/>
                They noticed that when the train is clean and maintained people treat it with more care. Making it easier to maintain.<br/>
                And if the train were dirty and broken, people will treat it with less care. <br/>
                In software happens the same. <br/>
                If your product is broken, looks bad and doesn't work as intended. <br/>
                Your customer will probably not report issues as much as if your product were in a good shape. <br/>
                Don't treat as less to those minor issues. <br/><br/>
                <i>They treat you in the same way that you introduce yourself. If you look bad, you will be mistreated; if you look good, you will be hired. - Mirtha Legrand</i>
