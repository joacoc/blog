            <p>
                A few days ago in the middle of a coworker teaching <br/>
                when their learners asked what is needed to get into a programming job <br/>
                a wild "chispa" lighten up in a coworker mind.<br/>
                And he fastly mentioned me the sillabus "FPLB".<br/>
                Then he developed it a little more and it stands for this:<br/>
                <b>F</b>ramework (React, Flink, Rails..)<br/>
                <b>P</b>lataform (Mobile, web, consoles..)<br/>
                <b>L</b>anguage (Java, Python, R..)<br/>
                <b>B</b>usiness Rules<br/>
                These are four potential keys you want to know when landing for a job.<br/>
                If you have at least two of them you will have a good potential<br/>
                the more the better<br/>
                the less the harder.<br/>
            </p>
